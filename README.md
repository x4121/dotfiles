My dotfiles

## Contents
* fish shell
* vim
* emacs (testing)
* tmux
* mutt (unfinished)
* taskwarrior
* XCompose bindings
* powerline with patched fonts
* rofi
* solarized colors for most tools

## Install
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x4121/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`

## Warning
* This project is currently only tested against the most recent Ubuntu release (if even!)
* The install script will overwrite files,
read the [install.sh](install.sh) and
[symlinks.sh](symlinks.sh) if you want to know which.
* Use at your own risk!

## Other stuff
[Dell C1660 installation](doc/Dell_C1660.md)

## TODO
* test!
* move git projects in ppa
* better sync for taskwarrior and keepassx
* create symlinks for files in .config (fish, autostart)
* maybe add compiz/dconf settings
