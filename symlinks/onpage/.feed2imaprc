# Global options:
include-images: false

# Per-feed options:
# name: name of the feed (must be unique)
# url: HTTP[S] address where the feed has to be fetched
# target: the IMAP URI where to put emails. Should start with imap:// for IMAP,
#   imaps:// for IMAPS and maildir:// for a path to a local maildir.
# min-frequency: (in HOURS) is the minimum frequency with which this particular
#   feed will be fetched
# disable: if set to something, the feed will be ignored
# include-images: download images and include them in the mail? (true/false)
# reupload-if-updated: when an item is updated, and was previously deleted,
#   reupload it? (true/false, default true)
# always-new: feed2imap tries to use a clever algorithm to determine whether
#   an item is new or has been updated. It doesn't work well with some web apps
#   like mediawiki. When this flag is enabled, all items which don't match
#   exactly a previously downloaded item are considered as new items.
# ignore-hash: Some feeds change the content of their items all the time, so
#   feed2imap detects that they have been updated at each run. When this flag
#   is enabled, feed2imap ignores the content of an item when determining
#   whether the item is already known.
# dumpdir: (for debugging purposes) directory where all fetched feeds will be
#   dumped.
# Snownews/Liferea scripts support :
#   execurl: Command to execute that will display the RSS/Atom feed on stdout
#   filter: Command to execute which will receive the RSS/Atom feed on stdin,
#    modify it, and output it on stdout.
